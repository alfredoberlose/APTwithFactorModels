# Multifactor Asset Pricing with APT and Fama-French
This repository contains a university project carried out as part of a course on **Empirical Methods in Finance**. The objective is to apply the **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)** framework and the **Fama-French 3-Factor Model** to analyze the returns of selected US stocks over a 5-year period.
The work combines **econometric modeling**, **financial theory**, and **data-driven portfolio analysis** to estimate risk factor exposures and assess potential arbitrage opportunities.

##  Project Objectives
- Apply a multifactor asset pricing model to individual stocks
- Estimate the factor loadings (betas) using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression
- Assess the **statistical significance** of factor exposures via p-values
- Test for **absence of arbitrage** by constructing a factor-neutral portfolio
- Interpret results in the context of **APT equilibrium conditions**
